<p><strong>Jamstack is a modern web development architecture that leverages benefits of pre-rendering and decoupling to enable building secure, fast and scalable websites.</strong></p>
<p>Jamstack reduces complex logic and risk related to using dynamic servers and specialized hosting infrastructure by splitting the frontend into pre-built static pages and assets. The resulting package can be served at a very low cost from a CDN or an inexpensive traditional web hosting. Further enhancements and personalization can be done with <strong>JavaScript, GraphQL and external backend services (APIs)</strong>.</p>
<p>It is possible to build Jamstack sites that integrate with traditional content management systems, like WordPress, as content sources, or deploy <strong>headless CMS platforms</strong> like Ghost, Netlify CMS or KeystoneJS 5.</p>
<p>We are capable of building performant static websites and web applications using generators such as <strong>GatsbyJS, Eleventy, VuePress</strong>.</p>
