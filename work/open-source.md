For many decades, free and open-source software has been a powerful force that enabled millions of innovative commercial and non-commercial products come to life.

We believe in open source as a means to empower communities and foster innovation. We provide selected portions of our work as battle-tested and well-documented solutions that can be freely reused, build upon and improved.
